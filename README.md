# portfoleieio

This is my personal portfolio site.  It uses my 'pinned' github projects as a resource for serving up
project cards.  It requires a github credential for the information which couldn't be imbedded in the front
end.  I therefore created a server proxy for all graphql requests to github which imbeds the credential on behalf
of the client.
